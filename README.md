# pivotal-kanban-board
A Kanban board display of your Pivotal Tracker stories (single html page, runs locally, uses pivotal API)

It's a single html page that runs locally.
It asks for your Pivotal API key, and it builds a URL that contains it i.e. it's not stored anywhere, or accessible to anyone else.
You can select a Pivotal project, and a Label/Epic, and then you can bookmark at any stage.

It's very rudimentary. Please feel free to improve it.
